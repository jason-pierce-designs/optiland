Lately, Optimism has been more active than ever, with the drop of the OP token
and the first of three massive airdrops to its customer base. We don't yet know
the criteria for the second drop, but I for one have been poking around for easy
and interesting ways to stay active. The goal is simple - see what I can have fun
doing, all while taking advantage of low gas fees with high security, and hopefully
make a buck here or there and learn something new. To follow up on Cryptovania's
"storyverse" concept, a card game NFT collection called **Dragonia** is coming soon,
exclusively to Optimism.

What makes this collection unique is that it brings with it a turn-based card game
with incentives to hold, and play daily. The rules of the game are described on
the rules page of their [website](https://www.dragonia.gg/#rules). Basically you
square off against another Trainer and take turns delivering hit points that magnify
by matching dragon elements and Trainer elements, and the winner receives XP which
they can use for more rewards, but there's a cooldown. So holders are encouraged to
play often, and fairly. In addition, half of all commissions on secondary sales are
given back to the holders on a scale, based on the rarity of their Trainer(s). The
rarest type, "Dragonborn", consists of a very small percentage of Trainers and when it
comes to revenue, gets 3% of the total, split between the Dragonborn holders. "Legendary"
Trainers get 33%, and "Common" Trainers get 66%. Most people won't get much just for holding
one Trainer of any type, but in time, for some it may cover gas fees for the month
on Optimism!

Gameplay happens off-chain so it's actions are seemless and gameplay is fast, but Players
have to re-sync to claim on-chain rewards using their earned XP and other goodies. This is
why Optimism was hands down their first and only choice. Players will want to be active and
are incentivized to play and earn real rewards. The Dragonia team also chose Optimism because
they heard the Optimism community and support was warm and welcoming. Check out this card below
that the Dragonia and Optimism teams constructed **together**!

By the time you read this blog post, the Dragonia team might be revealing that sick looking card
NFT live on the air with the Optimism team as part of demo day! With super cool dragon art like
that, plenty of rewards for collecting and playing, and an active team that cares about their
community, Dragonia is a project you don't want to miss out on.
