Our second Companion NFT release is here, and we're updating a few things on our end to go along with it!

First of all, the site you are using right now, to read this post, has been something that we've been working on since February, just after we released the Pixel Bunnies set. We wanted to make the minting process more seemless and less error prone, and better using the Web3 stack to allow the user to do more on the site without needing to connect their wallet.

The inspiration for Optiland Citizens stems from anime characters gaining in popularity on Layer 1, and to give our bunny holders yet another freebee they would actually want to use - something they would feel proud to make their profile photo.

Citizens are airdropped **for free** to new and old bunny holders alike (one per wallet) until they all mint out!
