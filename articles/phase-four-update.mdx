The next focus of the project is on community building and collaborating with other NFT projects on Optimism.

We have a great community that we've built over the past 6 months and I expect the community to continue to grow. We want to take our community to the next level by introducing more activities that are fun for bunny holders to participate. As a bunny holder, you may get free mints or whitelist from other projects as we increase our circle of friends in the Optimism NFT space.

The warren is growing daily! It's an exciting time to be a member of the bunnies community.
