Last week we had a fantastic AMA session with the Cryptovania team on Twitter Spaces to get
into the nitty-gritty of how their brand new **storyverse** NFT project is going to work, how they
plan to release, and an overview of the team and their inspiration. The following is a paraphrased completely
of how that went.

DistractionBoy: When do you plan on opening the mint, and how can listeners get on a whitelist? Will there be one?

A: No, we're not going to do a whitelist, but we will be giving out a different set of NFT's called
Cryptovania Blood Runes, and with each Blood Rune you can claim one free Cryptovania NFT. All next week,
if you stay tuned to our Discord Server

DistractionBoy: I read the whitepaper over on ‘https://cryptovania.gitbook.io’ and I really like this idea of taking
a step backwards to the bloggy storytelling days of web1, because it inspires creativity. Can
you talk a little bit about how you were inspired to bake that into an NFT project and how you
discovered it can be coded into a smart contract?

A: We are all big gamers, having played games like Halo, Mass Effect... ones like that, where you
kind of craft your own story... and we recognized how the story aspect has declined in recent years.
We wanted to bring that creativity to web3 and the NFT space on Optimism. As for the technical
capabilities, we lean on Mark [from Quixotic] for those details.

DistractionBoy: You know, it's funny that you mention Halo, because that's where my screen name comes from.
Just before I left for the Army, my best friend and I were living together and would play through the game
on Legendary all the time. You know that one snow level where you go through it kinda ... reverse? Well, my
friend would say, "go run out there and be distraction boy so the snipers pop their heads out and I can get 'em".
You know, one of the things I like about this project is that it’s not so focused on the monetary aspect, where
luck of the draw completely dictates an NFT’s worth… but let’s talk Tokenomics. There’s going to be a total of
10,000 mintable characters of either peasant or noble backgrounds, but if every single one of them tests their
might against Dracula, we could end up with a collection of just 1,000, based on the rough probability of
becoming immortal. That’s a really interesting way to increase rarity. Your thoughts?

A: Oh, yeah, so for those listening who might not know, we're building this mechanism into the collection where
an NFT holder can **go up against Dracula** and risk their NFT for a chance of it becoming "immortal" and the
some other visual aspects will change... like maybe their skin will change color and stuff like that. But if you
lose the battle with Dracula, then your NFT gets burned and you lose it forever. And you have a rougly 1 in 10
chance of winning. So yes, we would imagine that over time, as more players risk their NFT's, the ones that remain
may be more valuable.

DistractionBoy: But while you hold your NFT, you can keep contributing to the story of your NFT, and the story
of the collection.

A: Yes, that's correct. And you can affirm other people's stories, and over time, bits and pieces of stories become
**canon**, so maybe multiple people talk about "the church in the middle of the town square", and then future stories
that talk about the church need to make sure that they keep it in that location in their stories.

DistractionBoy: That's so cool. I really like that aspect. So, one final question. I saw in the whitepaper that
you are hoping other developers would build unique websites and things to help bolster this idea of the storyverse.
Are there any particular ideas or capabilities that you can think of that you'd like to see from the community?

A: One idea we had is that someone might have a page of their website that is devoted to all those who went up against
Dracula and has a gravestone for everyone that perished, or maybe groups of friends could build a site that is concentrated
on their stories.

DistractionBoy: Oh I see. Ok. ... Now you're getting the wheels turning in my head about the possibilities.
Well, thank you for joining this little Q&A session, and we here at Optiland really hope your project does well,
and we can't wait to see how everything goes!
