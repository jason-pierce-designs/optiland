We had reached and surpassed the 60% minted mark when Optimism released the news about their upcoming token release and airdrops. Now that we have a little more time to catch our breath, we would like to announce that the next donation to retroactive public goods has been made. This brings the running total of donated funds up to 6% total revenue.

Retroactive Public Goods (PDF) is a fund that is contributed to by those whose projects are successful and pulled from by those who want to build.
