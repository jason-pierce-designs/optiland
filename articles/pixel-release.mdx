In keeping with our promises, we released a second collection of bunnies - Pixel Bunnies! These NFT's have _more_ unique accessories than Optimistic Bunnies, and you get them **for free** by holding newly minted bunnies long enough to receive the airdrop.

Pixel Bunnies get airdropped in batches, usually once per week, and it's a one-to-one relationship. So for every new Optimistic Bunny you mint, you will receive one Pixel Bunny.

Thank you for being an early Optimism adopter and a holder of its **first** NFT collection.
